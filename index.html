Hello! My name is YuJin Choi.<br>I am an exchange student from South Korea.<br> Hansung University
which is in Seoul is one of the most beautiful university in Korea. <br> Because there are small mountain back side of our 
university.<br> I also major in 
visual design and double major in fashion design.<br>When I was young, my mom always showed
me a fashion magazine or a interior magazine.<br>I think that's why I became interested in art.<br>
When I have a time, I usually go to a gallery or exhibition and see art pieces.<br>
I feel comfortable when I go there.<br>
I have an experience in internships at SAE-A fashion company this year.<br>
I am really happy to join this class.
